# React Router Task

## Task Description

The objective of this task is to create a web page with multiple routes using `react-router-dom`. The design of the page should be inspired by the blog navigation found at [GUVI Blog](https://www.guvi.in/blog/).

### Key Features
- The page will feature a navigation bar similar to the one found in the middle of the page on the GUVI blog.
- The navigation bar should include the following categories:
  - **All**
  - **Full Stack Development**
  - **Data Science**
  - **Cyber Security**
  - **Career**
- Clicking on any of these navigation items should display static content associated with each category.

## Requirements

- Use `react-router-dom` to create the different routes for the navigation menu.
- Each category page should display static content. The content doesn't need to be fetched dynamically; it can be hardcoded into separate components.
- The layout and structure of the navigation bar should mimic the one in the screenshot provided below (taken from the GUVI blog).

### Resources
- Refer to the official [React Router documentation](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for guidance on how to set up routes and navigation.
- Link to the reference webpage: [GUVI Blog](https://www.guvi.in/blog/).
