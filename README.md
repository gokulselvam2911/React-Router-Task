### Key Features
- The page will feature a navigation bar similar to the one found in the middle of the page on the GUVI blog.
- The navigation bar should include the following categories:
  - **All**
  - **Full Stack Development**
  - **Data Science**
  - **Cyber Security**
  - **Career**
- Clicking on any of these navigation items should display static content associated with each category.

## Requirements

- Use `react-router-dom` to create the different routes for the navigation menu.
- Each category page should display static content. The content doesn't need to be fetched dynamically; it can be hardcoded into separate components.
- The layout and structure of the navigation bar should mimic the one in the screenshot provided below (taken from the GUVI blog).

### Resources
- Refer to the official [React Router documentation](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for guidance on how to set up routes and navigation.
- Link to the reference webpage: [GUVI Blog](https://www.guvi.in/blog/).

## Technologies
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework for responsive design
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool that focuses on speed and performance
